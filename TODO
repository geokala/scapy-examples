- Add packet dissection class
- Add 'do' section for sending from not-your address
- Add section for how to dig into what different packet types require (scapy.<PACKETTYPE>.fields_desc starting point), e.g. include DNSQR type because it has an enum and strings, maybe MACQuery for shorts, bytes, etc (enum_field_type.s2i)
- IPv4 error on OSX: needs 2048 (IP code- where is this looked up?)
- DNS MX queries give bad results (recommend only A, AAAA, TXT, CNAME)

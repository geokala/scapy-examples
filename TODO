- Add packet dissection class
- Add 'do' section for sending from not-your address
- Add section for how to dig into what different packet types require (scapy.<PACKETTYPE>.fields_desc starting point), e.g. include DNSQR type because it has an enum and strings, maybe MACQuery for shorts, bytes, etc (enum_field_type.s2i)
- Probably need to use srp1 more, instead of sr1 (for layer2 packets)- see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18625072/understanding-the-scapy-mac-address-to-reach-destination-not-found-using-broad
- Can we suppress IPv6 warning?
- IPv4 error on OSX: needs 2048 (IP code- where is this looked up?)
